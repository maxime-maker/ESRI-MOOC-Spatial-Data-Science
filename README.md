# Spatial Data Science:
## The New Frontier in Analytics

### SECTION 1 or WEEK 1
 Introduction to Spatial Data Science

 Explore how spatial data, tools, and analysis techniques augment traditional data science. Understand that “spatial” means more than x,y coordinates and 
that place-based context reveals patterns in data that otherwise may be hidden. Start applying data engineering and visualization techniques in ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Notebooks.

### SECTION 2
 The Spatial Approach to Predictive Analysis

  Prediction is fundamental to data science. See how incorporating spatial properties into modeling workflows deepens understanding of data and adds 
predictive power. Learn how to apply random forest, a widely used machine learning approach, to solve problems. Train and evaluate a model, then use it to 
generate robust predictions.

### SECTION 3
 Finding Optimal Locations Using Suitability Models

 Apply widely used spatial analysis techniques to answer this universal question asked by all kinds of organizations: Where is the best location for <fill 
in the blank>? Perform a weighted overlay analysis that considers and ranks multiple suitability criteria. Learn how to transform data using functions to more 
completely represent suitability impact.

### SECTION 4
 Pattern Detection and Clustering

 Does a pattern have meaning or is it a product of random chance? ArcGIS includes a suite of tools to help analysts identify patterns and clusters in data 
and determine if they are meaningful. Learn how to apply statistical clustering methods to analyze patterns in space as well as time. Create a spacetime cube, 
then use space-time pattern mining tools to explore spatiotemporal trends and determine where and when high and low clusters occur.  

### SECTION 5
 Object Detection with Deep Learning

  Take a deep dive into extracting information from massive data using deep learning. Learn how to automate the process of detecting objects and 
identifying features from imagery. Practice preparing training sample data, then use a neural network to train an object detection model. 

### SECTION 6
 Communicating Results with Impact 

 Successful analysts and data scientists must be  effective storytellers. Learn how to present a complex analysis using information products that resonate 
with your audience. Design and build interactive, visual stories that share the key information you want decision-makers to understand and act on.
